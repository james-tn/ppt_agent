## Notes  
  
- Quantities are per subwoofer unit.  
- Certain items (e.g., surround, gasket, fasteners) are inferred from both the render and common subwoofer designs.  
- For manufacturing, specify exact materials, grades, magnet dimensions, and mechanical tolerances as required by your performance targets.
